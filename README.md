# Youtube MP3 Ripper

This is a simple winforms frontend app that uses ffmpeg and youtube-dl to rip youtube videos from a given url into MP3. Additional options in the app allow pulling video instead.

## For this to run properly, the following files must be put into the Lib folder
* ffmpeg.exe
* ffplay.exe
* ffprobe.exe
* youtube-dl.exe
